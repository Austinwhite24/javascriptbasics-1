// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
//Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, Which is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified."
const design = "This is the third step, The process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, This is the step of the process where software engineers actually start to program the code for the project."
const testingIntegration = "This is the fifth and final step, that focus's on testing the interface between two software units or module, doing so can help find what is correct and what might fail in the code."
const maintain = "set up procces to make sure it works down the road"
